# responsive-site-hw
Responsive portfolio website with about/home, portfolio, and contact pages.  Site currently contains no portfolios so placeholder images are currently being used until I have more work that I can add to the site.  This was an assignment to become more comfortable with the different components and features that bootstrap has to offer for making a much more responsive and user friendly website.  Below are attached images of each page on the site.
