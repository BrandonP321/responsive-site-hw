                            Hi there! My name is Brandon Phillips, I'm 20 years old, and I'm currently in the process of
                            receiving my full stack web developer certification through the University of Washington.
                            I attended Montana State University for one year, but I wasn't able to find the career path
                            that fit me. I then took some time away from school to try out different career paths, though it
                            took some time until I found what I think is right for me. After a year of failed attempts at
                            finding my career path, the lockdown began. What started out as me just learning a new skill to
                            keep my mind busy quickly turned into what I believe to be the career path that checks all the
                            boxes for me.  I hope to use this certification in web development as a way to 'break in' to the 
                            coding industry so that I can later on work into a more software development oriented career, working 
                            with languages such as python and java.
